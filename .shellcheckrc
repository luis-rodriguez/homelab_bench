# ShellCheck Configuration for homelab_bench
# https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive

# Enable following of sourced files (same as -x flag)
# This allows shellcheck to analyze sourced modules
# external-sources=true  # Handled via -x flag in workflows

# Disable specific warnings that are expected in this project

# SC1091: Not following: file not found
# Reason: Some scripts source files dynamically or from relative paths
disable=SC1091

# SC2034: Variable appears unused
# Reason: Many variables are used by sourced modules or passed to functions
# We handle this on a case-by-case basis rather than disabling globally
# disable=SC2034

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Reason: Common pattern in our scripts, and we handle errors explicitly
# disable=SC2155

# Set shell to bash (most scripts use #!/usr/bin/env bash)
shell=bash

# Enable all optional checks
# enable=all

# Set severity threshold (error, warning, info, style)
# In CI we use --severity=warning flag
# severity=warning

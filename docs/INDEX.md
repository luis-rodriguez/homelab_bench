This index lists the main documentation pages in `docs/` with a short one-line description. These pages are published to GitHub Pages.

- index.md — Site home and overview
- orchestrator.md — How the orchestrator (`bin/homelab_benchmark.sh`) works and its options
- local.md — Local benchmark workflow and interpretation of results
- remote.md — Running remote benchmarks and SSH setup
- troubleshooting.md — Common problems and fixes
- contributing.md — How to contribute
- releases/ — Release notes (per-version)
- legacy/ — Legacy docs from the previous layout (kept for reference)

If you want additional descriptions or ordering, tell me and I'll update this index.

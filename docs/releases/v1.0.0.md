# Release v1.0.0

Release tag: `v1.0.0`

Date: 2025-10-18

This release marks the audited and hardened initial version of the Homelab Benchmarking Suite.

Contents

- `homelab_benchmark.sh` — Multi-host orchestrator (hardening: SSH option arrays, host validation, DRY-RUN, safer iperf handling).
- `local_benchmark.sh` — Local runner (hardening: mktemp, trap cleanup, DRY-RUN, sudo preflight).
- `SECURITY.md`/`SECURITY_POLICY.md`/`SECURITY_AUDIT*.md` — Security policy and audit notes.
- CI:
  - `.github/workflows/shellcheck.yml` — Run ShellCheck and `bash -n`.
  - `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` — Smoke tests that run the scripts with `--dry-run`.

Highlights and important notes

- Non-destructive by default: `NON_DESTRUCTIVE_ONLY` is set to `true` in scripts and should not be changed unless you understand the implications.
- Dry-run mode: Use `--dry-run` when testing; the smoke tests exercise this mode.
- Tool installation is opt-in: use `--install-tools --yes` to allow unattended installs, and only when you trust the target host.
- Host validation: `HOSTS` entries are validated for safe characters. Provide only trusted host entries.

Upgrade & Verification

1. Check out the `v1.0.0` tag locally:

   git fetch --tags
   git checkout v1.0.0

2. Run smoke tests locally (no remote actions):

   bin/homelab_benchmark.sh --dry-run
   ./local_benchmark.sh --dry-run

3. Review the security documents:

   - `SECURITY.md` — vulnerability reporting and contact
   - `SECURITY_POLICY.md` — operational safety rules
   - `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` & `SECURITY_AUDIT_LOCAL.md` — audit findings and applied fixes

Known limitations & future work

- The orchestrator still requires careful review of `HOSTS` entries before running in production.
- Consider enabling `rsync --checksum` for result transfers and more robust verification of transferred files.
- Consider an optional interactive installer or an approval workflow for remote package installation.

# Release v1.1

Date: 2025-10-18

Highlights
- Bumped automated audit updater to tag v1.1 and improved ShellCheck formatting.
- CI workflow `update-audits` hardened to commit generated audit files to the branch.
- Release branch `release/v1.1` created and audit files regenerated.

Testing
- Smoke tests run locally in dry-run mode; CI smoke workflow expected to run on push.

Notes
- Final publishing step (creating/publishing GitHub release) is manual unless you want me to create a draft via the `gh` CLI.
